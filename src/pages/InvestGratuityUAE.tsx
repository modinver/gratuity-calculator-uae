                  The best investment strategy depends on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Generally, a diversified approach including real estate, mutual funds, fixed deposits, and government bonds provides balance. For long-term growth, real estate and equity investments often yield better returns, while fixed deposits and bonds offer stability with lower risk.

                  Yes, gratuity can be used to fund visa applications, including investor visas. The UAE offers various investor visa options, each with specific financial requirements. Your gratuity payment can provide the necessary capital to meet these requirements, particularly if you're transitioning from employment to entrepreneurship.

                  Generally, it's advisable to first pay off high-interest debts like credit cards and personal loans before investing. However, if your debts have low interest rates, you might benefit from investing a portion of your gratuity while systematically reducing your debt. This balanced approach can help build wealth while improving your financial position.

                  Financial experts typically recommend keeping 3-6 months' worth of living expenses as an emergency fund. If you don't already have this safety net in place, prioritize allocating a portion of your gratuity to establish this fund before making long-term investments.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The UAE doesn't impose income tax on individuals, so gratuity payments and investment returns are generally tax-free for residents. However, if you're an expatriate planning to return to your home country, you should consider the tax regulations there, as some countries tax foreign-earned income and investment returns. Consulting with a tax advisor familiar with both jurisdictions is advisable.
